<!-- ABOUT THE PROJECT -->
## 📝 About The Project

Engenious Recruitment is a website I developed to help streamline the hiring process for a leading recruitment firm specializing in the construction sector. The goal was to create a highly functional, user-friendly platform that meets the needs of both job seekers and recruiters.

The site integrates several features to facilitate the recruitment process, including easy navigation, job listing management, candidate application tracking, and a visually appealing design that communicates professionalism. It also incorporates mobile responsiveness to ensure smooth browsing across devices.

Throughout this project, I focused on enhancing both the user experience (UX) and technical performance, while ensuring the website remains easy to maintain and scalable as the client’s needs evolve. This project not only highlights my full-stack development skills but also demonstrates my ability to collaborate with clients and tailor digital solutions to their business needs.
