      "Philippa jumped into the recruitment world in 2012, diving headfirst into permanent search and select hires for the civil engineering and construction sectors. By 2021, she decided, \"Why not start my own agency?\" And thus, Engenious Recruitment was born, where quality and service aren’t just priorities—they’re practically family members at this point.",
      "When she’s not running the show at work, Philippa’s busy keeping up with her two boys, who keep her on her toes. Her hobbies? Well, she’s basically a superhero—running, weight training, cooking, and staying fit. Oh, and she’s training for her sixth half marathon… because apparently, five just didn’t cut it!"

Understanding exactly what motivates our candidates (besides caffeine), and helping them land their dream job. She’s like a career matchmaker, but with fewer awkward dates.", "In her spare time, Letitia is basically a professional dog walker for her pup Bentley, racking up more steps than a fitness app can count—15,000 a day through fields and woods! When she’s not busy being a step-counting champion, you’ll find her enjoying time with friends, family, and her young son, mastering the art of multitasking like a pro."]
